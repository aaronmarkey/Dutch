A tip calculator used to calculate how much each person in a party should pay for a meal. Demonstrates the use of TextFields, Sliders, property observers, auto-layout, and rotation scaling.

Ideally, this app would allow the user to ask for payments from other through some payment method. Probably through Venmo.
